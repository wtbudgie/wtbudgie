👋 Hi there, I'm Will, a **Backend Developer** with **2 years of experience in JavaScript and TypeScript!**

💻 Currently, I'm working on an awesome bot called **Resolv**, helping people manage their staff teams and in the future help with the logisitics of their discord server. I'm also always tinkering away on personal projects to learn new things and expand my skill set.

🕵️‍♂️ I love to get under the hood of things and understand what's happening behind the scenes. It's this curiosity that drives me to continually improve my coding abilities and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the world of software development.

✈️ When I'm not coding, you can find me indulging my passion for aviation. I'm always exploring the latest advancements in technology and soaking up the wonder of flight.

🚀 Whether I'm building something new or geeking out about airplanes, I'm always excited to learn and grow. Feel free to reach out and connect!
You can contact me through discord: `willl#9080`
